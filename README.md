# Car Setup Installer for iRacing
A simple program that acts as a GUI for installing setup files in iRacing. 
For some users, navigating and organizing your setup files in the file explorer can be confusing and difficult, especially when you need to first extract a zip file, then move the .sto's to the correct location. 
This installer was created to make it easy to install your iRacing setups in the correct location. 

------------------
## Windows 11 Users

Windows 11 Users may receive a "Windows protected your PC" popup; simply click "More Info" and "Run anyway."
This is because the software has not been certified by a 3rd party certificate agency. These certificates are expensive, and this is a simple project.
## Application Options
### Adding items to dropdown with CarSelection.ini
In your documents folder -> Car Setup Installer for iRacing -> Configuration, there is a file named "CarSelection.ini". (C:\Users\[USERNAME]\Documents\Car Setup Installer for iRacing\Configuration) 

This file contains all the cars that appear in the dropdown menu, along with their respective setup folder. The structure is:

[CAR NAME]:[iRacing Setup Folder]
Where [CAR NAME] can be anything you'd like, and it will be what is shown in the dropdown. [iRacing Setup Folder] is the destination. This would theoretically be a folder iRacing has created, but you could technically make it any destination folder. 
### Default iRacing Location
By default, the program will assume your iRacing default setup location is in Documents>iRacing>Setups.
If you'd like to change that, simply go to options in the top left and modify your default location. Make sure that you only select your "Setups" folder, not a certain car. 

### Remove file Checkbox
The "Remove File From Original Location When Completed" Checkbox will cut and paste your files rather than Copy and Paste them. This can be useful if you are moving the setup files from your "Downloads" folder, for example. 

If you actually read the ReadMe, thanks, and I hope you enjoy the program.
